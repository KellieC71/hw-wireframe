                                <h3> History </h3>
                                <p>I am 47 years old.  About 3 years ago I had a strange headache and went to the doctor.  The doctor sent me to get a cat scan at the ER.  On the CT they saw four brain anyeurisms.  This was alarming because my father died at 60 yrs old from an anyeurism.  They did alot of testing and came to the conclusino that I would need to get stents put in my brain to heal the anyeurisms.  I was sent home and told to see an intevenious radiologist.  I googled the stent procedure and found a Dr at Loyola Hospital in Chicago that saved a womens life by puting stents in her brain.  So i called him.  Dr. Ashely was super nice and super smart.  He explained that if I did this procedure I would litterally save my life. He would have to do it twice tho. I had two anyeurisms on each side of my brain called mirror anyeurisms.  So he said he could do the procesure in the next day or two. It was the scariest time of my life.  I had never been put asleep for a procudure before so that was scary to me as well as having someone go into my vein at the groin all the way up to my brain.  The procdure was over before I knew it.  However, he saw seven anyeurisms instead of the inital two that were found on the CT. I also had to stay in intensive care over night.  Two weeks later I had to do it all over again.  Again he found three anyeurisms instead of the intial two.  So I had a total of 10 all together.  Now I just have to be monitored each year and take blood thinners which is a small price to pay for life.  Although I have extra risks with this problem. About a year ago. I felt like my smile was crooked and my kids said that I was acting drunk.  Also I had a headache and felt naseuous. So I went to my local dr.  They couldn't find anything so they did an MRI. On the MRi they found that I had a stroke.  There is a tiny part of my brain that is literally dead. This is why I am grateful to be able to attend the UCF Coding BootCamp. Even though it is extremly hard and I can't remember that well. I am proud that I am able to attend and grateful to be alive to see my daughter graduate College.  So when I feel down and stupid I think of how far I have come and remember I could not be her right now so whatever I do or learn is a huge accoplishment.</p>

                       What is flow diversion?
                        Flow diversion is an endovascular technique whereby instead of placing a device inside the aneurysm sac, such as with coiling, the device is placed in the parent blood vessel to divert blood flow away from the aneurysm itself.
                        How is flow diversion/Pipeline™ performed?
                        Flow diversion slide Pipeline™ stent being placed
                        During a flow-diversion/Pipeline™ procedure, a microcatheter is navigated past the aneurysm without having to enter the aneurysm. Then, the flow-diverting device (Pipeline™ Embolization Device) is deployed across the neck of the aneurysm in the parent blood vessel where the aneurysm is present.
                        Almost immediately the blood flow to the aneurysm is reduced, and the complete closure of the aneurysm occurs between 6 weeks to 6 months after the procedure.
